# Burger

## Description

This project creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.  It follows the MVC design pattern.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page.  It will also store every burger in a database.
